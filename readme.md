Visi
====

To start development, open `visi.xcworkspace` in XCode. This project was developed with XCode 9.4.1 on OSX 10.13.6.

Install OpenCV with `brew install opencv`. Then run `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` and replace the "Header Search Paths" and "Library Search Paths" in the `visi-core` project with the appropriate paths to your installation.
